### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for checking out my professional statement!

I am a highly motivated cybersecurity engineer who strives to make the workplace more ethically balanced. To achieve that goal I actively work to create tools and procedures that help detect and analyze potential threats, risks and vulnerabilities to ensure that data remain confidential and available.
